# AQTS

This repository houses example scripts for interested parties to review. Additions still ongoing. 

Note: certain logic in these classes depends on the original binary data file names. Other than that, the scripts themselves use static file name forms for each step in the data extraction and analysis workflow. Additionally, the data is not provided here as it would be a large upload but is available for demonstration if requested.
